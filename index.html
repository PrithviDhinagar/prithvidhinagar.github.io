					<p>
						As a Computer Science student, I learned all the basics of computer science which provided me with a lot of exposure and a solid foundation in the technical side of the industry. I've always had an interest to code and develop games and I believe that learning about various algorithms and coding languages in my undergraduate degree gave me the clarity to decide what I wanted to do next. With a growing passion to develop games, I decided to work on a variety of basic personal projects and endless motion multilevel games, including The Obstacle Course, The Box Shooter, and Roller Madness,
						which gave me the confidence and inspiration to continue learning. All of these projects have shown me that game development is a broad subject with much more to learn and explore. I also learnt a variety of skills including Animation rigging, handling Cinemachine brain, working with animator and animator controller and some important concepts required to develop a game during my internship. The following are some of the experimental and self-taught projects which I worked on.
